## Name
Mech Final Project -- The M.E Complexity --

## Description
The objective is to construct a small independent robot that can navigate a standardized field with efficiency and robustness, locate the goal location, and shoot the ping-pong ball into the goal. Points will be awarded for each ball that makes it into the goal, and additional points will be given for more difficult zones on the field.
